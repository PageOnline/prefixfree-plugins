# Some PrefixFree plugins
## [Generating random numbers](prefixfree.random.js)

Plugin: prefixfree.random.js
With this plugin you can use in CSS something like this

```css
.some-class {
	width: random(20, 50)px;
}
```

This will generate random number in the range of 20 and 50.

It's easy, doesn't it? :)
